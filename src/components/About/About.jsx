          Originally from Upstate New York, I graduated from SUNY Oswego in 2013
          with a dual bachelor's degree; one in Education and the other in
          Advanced Literature. I taught in South Carolina for ten years,
          eventually finding myself in North Carolina. <br></br>
          <br></br>I have always had a{' '}
          <span className='underline--magical'>
            {' '}
            passion for software development{' '}
          </span>{' '}
          and all that comes with the field - particularly reading documentation
          into the night. ðŸ™ƒ I decided to complete a six-month full stack boot
          camp through UNC-Chapel Hill. As of August 2023, I earned my
          certificate and I am excited to shift my career path.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          My experiences have given me exceptional skills in{' '}
          <span className='underline--magical'> leadership</span>,
          <span className='underline--magical'> collaboration</span>, and
          <span className='underline--magical'> problem-solving</span>. I have a
          natural drive to organize, meet deadlines, and overcome challenges. It
          has always been so satisfying to fix a bug or have my work make others
          happy.

          <p>
            My time working within the field of education granted me
            opportunities to work with a variety of stakeholders & develop a
            strong skill set. These skills give me an upper hand when working on
            a team & gives me the discipline to continue my own personal growth.
            Because of this, I am consistently seeking information in order to
            better my craft.
