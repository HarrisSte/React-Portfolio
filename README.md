## Contributors
A great deal of research, reading, and learning occurred while working on this project. First, I started by accessing the materials that were provided by my instructor, TAs, and the boot camp itself. I worked through previous recordings of lessons to debug issues. I also conferred with a colleague of mine, Andrew to debug an issue with rendering on Netlify.
<br>
<br>
Outside sources came from both React and Bootstrap documentation to understand further how the two can work together and how to implement components in my application seamlessly. I also read through several articles provided by Medium, web.dev, Stackoverflow, and W3Schools. 
<br>
<br>
In developing the contact form and resume download button, I read through two separate articles; [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-download-pdf-file-in-reactjs/) and [Positronx](https://www.positronx.io/how-to-build-a-simple-contact-form-in-react-js-app/). Once I understood the functionality, I made changes to correspond with what I needed.
<br>
<br>
The styling inspiration came from the banner photo that I took myself. From there, I used Coolors to aid in a color scheme that would be visually appealing. I also utilized the expansive library that Google Fonts has to offer.
